<h1>State synchronization in postlock</h1>
<h2>Terms used in this document</h2>
<dl>
<dt>common state</dt><dd>State stored by the postlock state server. Always has an id which is a nonnegative integer (no dot).</dd>
<dt>proposed state</dt><dd>
Each time a client applies an operation locally, it informs the state server of how to reach the resulting state through a transaction message. 
The participant's post-operation state is a proposed state since it has not yet been acknowledged by the postlock server. Proposed states
have a version number of <b>X.Y</b> where X is the initial common state (a state which has been acknowledged by the server), and Y is the 
number of modifications made since the common state (since it's possible to run several operations before feedback for the first operation arrives).
</dd>
<dt>transaction</dt><dd>A set of operations which move state between versions. Transactions have the following properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Atomicity: if any of the operations fails, postlock will return to the starting state.</li>
                <li>Deterministic: their success or failure must be determined by the shared state alone.</li>
            </ul>
</dd>
<dt>participant</dt><dd>Any process in the postlock session which can send messages to the other participants. Every browser connecting through <em>postlock.js</em> is a participant, but so is the state server for example.</dd>
<dt>postlock client</dt><dd>A postlock participant running on the end user's hardware (eg. postlock.js running in a browser). Note that clients are treated the same way as other participants by postlock, this terminology is only useful when documenting how postlock works.</dd>
<dt>postlock server</dt><dd>The message passing and state synchronization part of postlock. Participants which run on the server (eg. php bridge) are not considered part of the postlock server.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Scope of this document</h2>
Postlock participants (both client and server) maintain their own copy of shared state, allowing them to perform any operation locally.
This allows developers to create extremely responsive collaborative applications and frees them from the burden of locking
shared objects. Since each participant can perform any operation independently, their copies of shared state will gradually diverge 
until the next synchronization with the server. This document describes the synchronization mechanizm which guarantees that the local
state of each client follows the state of the postlock server. In a nutshell, the protocol has the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Participant A makes a local modification, and sends this modification to the state server as a transaction.</li>
<li>Any number of participants may send modifications to the server which are executed before A's message.</li>
<li>After receiving A's message, the server transforms it to take into account all the other transactions processed in step 2</li>
<li>The server sends A the result of its transaction along with any modifications committed by other participants in step 2. If A's transaction was successfully applied then the other participants also receive A's transaction.</li>
</ol>
<br />
Note that it is possible to simply poll the postlock state server for the value of an object so keeping a local copy of state is not 
mandatory. This functionality is useful for building interfaces to languages with request-based execution models (eg. php) but normal
participants have much to loose by taking this route.<br />

<h2>Synchronization examples</h2>
The following examples aim to give the reader an understanding of the steps taken during synchronization, and what messages are exchanged
between participants.
<h3>1. Success</h3>
<p>
The <a href="svg/synchronization-success.svg">following diagram</a> is a simple example for synchronization in postlock.
<center>
<object data="svg/synchronization-success.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="800" height="800"></object>
</center>
Example 1 consists of the following sequence:
<ol>
    <li>
        Client A deletes 'b' from the list, resulting in the message:
        <pre>
        {
            from: 2, // [client A is participant 2]
            to: 1,   // [the state server is participant 1]
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0:0.1',
                ops: [
                    ['delete', 1]
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Client B inserts 'e' right after 'b'
        <pre>
        {
            from: 3, // [client B is participant 3]
            to: 1,   // [the state server is participant 1]
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0:0.1',
                ops: [
                    ['insert', 2, 'e']
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>

    </li>
    <li>
        The server receives A's transaction and names the resulting state common state 1. It notifies both participants:
        <pre>
        // Server to A 
        {
            from: 1, 
            to: 2,
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0.1:1',
                result: {
                    re: "0:0.1",
                    code: 0 // success
                },
                ops: []
            }
        }

        // Server to B
        {
            from: 1,
            to: 3,
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0:1',
                ops: [
                    ['delete', 1]
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>
        Note that B will discard the server's message, as it is no longer in state 0 (it is in state 0.1), thus it cannot execute the transaction.
        There is no need to notify the server, as it will receive B's '0:0.1' transaction which is an implicit negative acknowledgement for
        the server's '0:1' message.
    </li>
    <li>
        The server receives B's transaction, which it transforms to take into account A's delete. Since the list item at position 1 was removed, 
        every latter item will have its index lowered by one. In our case, <code>insert(2,'d') =&gt; insert(1, 'e')</code><br />The transformed transaction is successfully applied resulting in common state 2.
        Both participants are informed of this.
        <pre>
        // Server to B
        {
            from: 1, 
            to: 3,
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0.1:2',
                result: {
                    re: "0:0.1",
                    code: 0 // success
                },
                ops: [
                    ['delete', 1]
                ]
            }
        }

        // Server to A
        {
            from: 1,
            to: 2,
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '1:2',
                ops: [
                    ['insert', 1, 'e'] // Note that A gets the same transformed operation that the server executed not the one sent by B.
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>
Things to note in this example:
<ul>
<li>Clients can discard the server's deprecated transactions without the need for a reply.</li>
<li>A transaction can span several states, like the '0.1:2' transaction above.</li>
<li>The server will try to execute a participant's message even if it is out of date, but it will apply an <b>operational transform</b> first.</li>
<li>The server only goes from common state to common state. If a participant executes a transaction sent by the server, then it will wind up in one of these common states. As a result all participants will eventually converge on the same server state.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>2. Failure</h3>
<p>
Some transactions are mutually exclusive, resulting in the latter transaction failing. The 
<a href="svg/synchronization-fail.svg">following diagram</a> provides an example.
<center>
<object data="svg/synchronization-fail.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="800" height="800"></object>
</center>
Example 2 consists of the following sequence:
<ol>
    <li>Client A deletes 'b' from the list.
        <pre>
        {
            from: 2, // [client A is participant 2]
            to: 1,   // [the state server is participant 1]
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0:0.1',
                ops: [
                    ['delete', 1]
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Client B moves 'b' to the beginning of the list.
        <pre>
        {
            from: 3, // [client B is participant 3]
            to: 1,   // [the state server is participant 1]
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0:0.1',
                ops: [
                    ['move', 1, 0]
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>The server receives and applies A's transaction, notifying both clients.
        <pre>
        // Server to A
        {
            from: 1, 
            to: 2,
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0.1:1',
                result: {
                    re: "0:0.1",
                    code: 0 // success
                },
                ops: []
            }
        }

        // Server to B
        {
            from: 1,
            to: 3,
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0:1',
                ops: [
                    ['delete', 1]
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>
        As in example 1, B will discard the server's '0:1' message as it is in state 0.1 by that point.
    </li>
    <li>
        The server receives B's transaction -which it cannot apply. It sends operations which undo the transaction
        that B just sent, plust the <code>delete</code> operation submitted by A.
        <pre>
        {
            from: 1, 
            to: 3,
            type: 'transaction',
            body: {
                tid: '0.1:1',
                result: {
                    re: "0:0.1",
                    code: 1 // failure
                },
                ops: [
                    ['move', 0, 1], // takes B back to common state 0
                    ['delete', 1]   // takes B from state 0 to 1
                ]
            }
        }
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>
Things to note about this example:
<ul>
    <li>A failed transaction results in no message sent to the other participants by the server.</li>
    <li>Currently, the server makes the participant return to the last common state (0 in our example) before it advances to the server's current state(1).
        It is possible to implement this more efficiently: in this case, <code>delete(0)</code> would have been enough. Eventually, we plan to
        include such optimizations in postlock.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Multiple proposed states</h2>
<p>
In the examples above, only a single proposed state was reached before the server could issue a response to the clients. In practice it can often
be the case that the user performs several operations in quick succession before the first one is acknolwedged by the server. In this case, the
client will always send transactions which move the server from the last common state to the last proposed state. For example, let's say the
user executes the following 3 operations on list [a,b,c] (which is in common state 0):
<ol>
<li>delete(0) -&gt; [b,c]</li>
<li>move(1,0) -&gt; [c,b]</li>
<li>insert(1,'f') -&gt; [c,f,b]</li>
</ol>
The client would send the postlock server the following three messages:
<pre>
{ 
    from: 2, 
    to: 1, 
    type: 'transaction',
    body: { 
        tid: '0:0.1',
        ops: [
            ['delete', 0]
        ]
    }
}

{ 
    from: 2, 
    to: 1, 
    type: 'transaction',
    body: { 
        tid: '0:0.2',
        ops: [
            ['delete', 0],
            ['move', 1, 0]
        ]
    }
}

{ 
    from: 2, 
    to: 1, 
    type: 'transaction',
    body: { 
        tid: '0:0.3',
        ops: [
            ['delete', 0],
            ['move', 1, 0],
            ['insert', 1, 'f'],
        ]
    }
}
</pre>
The server receives each message and sends an appropriate response, but it will be discarded by the client which has moved on to a latter 
state by that point. If the first transaction is successful, and delete(0) has been applied, then the server will move its state from common
state 0 to 1. When the next transaction arrives ("0:0.2"), the server will notice that its state is newer than the starting state of the 
transaction, so it will apply an operational transform, resulting in the following operations:
<pre>
            ['noop'],           // this has already been applied: OT results in no operation
            ['move', 1, 0]      // no modification necessary as client and server states match at this point
</pre>
Eventually, the client will stop spewing transactions, so the server's response transaction will have the same starting state that the client is in.
After running this transaction, the client will be in a common state (in our case state 3).
</p>
<h2>A word about data types</h2>
<p>
The data types used in the examples above (eg: <code>[a,b,c]</code>) are not real postlock datatypes.
Although we plan to extend the set of data types available in postlock, the currently supported data types are:
<dl>
<dt>data</dt>
    <dd>Can be any JSON-encodeable data type. Examples: 
        <pre>
        1
        1.0
        true
        "a string"
        []
        [1,2,3,4]
        null,
        undefined,
        ['a list', 1, 3, "of different types],
        { any: "object"}
        { nested: 
            {s: "objects"}
        }
        </pre>
        Only a single operation is defined on data objects: <code>set()</code>, which changes its value.
    </dd>
<dt>dict</dt>
    <dd>Dicts are composed on entries which map a string to a postlock object. Operations:
        <ul>
            <li>set(key, object) - assigns an object to a given key</li>
            <li>remove(key) removes the given key from the dictionary (does not affect the object).</li>
        </ul>
        Note that changes to the objects which are the values of the dictionary do not change the dictionary itself.
        Conversely, modifying the dictionary does not impact any of the objects to which it points to.
    </dd>
<dt>list</dt><dd>Lists are collections of postlock objects in which the individual objects can be accessed based on their index. Operations:
        <ul>
            <li>insert(position, object) - adds the given object to the list at the specified position</li>
            <li>remove(position) - removes the list item at the given position.</li>
        </ul>
        Just as with dicts, the collection is handled separately from items, so changing an item does not affect the list and vice versa.
        Note that these two operations are sufficient to create transactions which <code>move</code>, <code>append</code> and preform the
        usual stack/queue operations.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<h2>'safe' operations to prevent data loss</h2>
<p>
Operations like <code>data.set()</code> could potentially lead to data loss if called by several participants on 
the same object. For example, take the following sequence:
<ol>
<li>Participant A applies <code>set(1)</code></li>
<li>Participant B applies <code>set(2)</code></li>
<li>The server receives A's transaction, which it applies and notifies A and B. B discards the server's message, since it is no longer in state 0.</li>
<li>The server receives B's transaction. It applies it, and notifies both A and B.</li>
</ol>
In the example above B overwrites A's value without being aware it happened. <br />
In order to prevent such situations, the default behavior of set() leads the transaction to fail if the 
starting state of the transaction indicates that the participant is not aware it is overwriting data.
Using this safe version of set, the following sequence of events would take place:
<ol>
<li>Participant A applies <code>set(1)</code></li>
<li>Participant B applies <code>set(2)</code></li>
<li>The server receives A's transaction, which it applies and notifies A and B. B discards the server's message, since it is no longer in state 0.</li>
<li>The server receives B's transaction, which has the id '0.1:1'. Since the server moved to state 1 by executing A's set(), it knows that
B was not aware of A's transaction when it issued its own. As a result, the server will fail the transaction, instructing B to run set(1). If B re-runs 
the operation (this time in transaction '1:1.1' ), then the server will apply the transaction, since B is aware it is overwriting data.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</body></html>
